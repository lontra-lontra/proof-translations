This work aims to discuss the translation between Tableaux proofs and sequent calculus proofs in first-order intuitionistic propositional logic and in first-order classical propositional logic.
It begins with an overview of the definitions and clarification of the notations.
It then shows a translation process in classical logic and its   \href{https://github.com/lontra-lontra/proof-translations}{OCAML implementation}.
Finally, a potential extension towards translation in intuitionistic logic is discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The topic}


Sequent calculus and the tableaux Method are both fundamental systems for representing and systematically generating logical proofs. 
Sequent calculus highlights the structure and rules of deduction, while tableaux proofs provide a more intuitive approach. 
Translating between proof systems is important for automatically verifying automatically generated proofs and understanding their relationships.

In this work, sentences will implicitly refer to first-order predicate logic sentences; In the translation discussed in chapter V, they 
will be implicitly restricted to the propositional fragment of first order logic in order to simplify the discussion. 
For intuitionistic logic, their meaning will come from Kripke's semantics \cite{kripke1965} . The notation for structures and frames, as well as the motivation for
the intuitionistic tableaux method will be heavily based on \cite{book1}. As in most of the proofs for the intuitionistic tableaux from \cite{book1}, there wont be any functions.  
In order to make this document slightly more self-contained and to clarify the notation, we will briefly explain:
\subsection{Definitions}
%(TODO how detailed? < or > than thepresentation? )

\structureDefinition
Structures represent possible worlds or possible states of knowledge inside a frame:
\kripkeFrameDefinition

Particularly, in order to simplify the notation, R will always be a set of sequences of integers in lexicographic order: $p \leq q$ if it exists an $l$ such that $q =  p:l$  . 
 Also, from now on, the constant elements of a language will always be in an ordered set $\{c_0, c_1, c_2 ...\}$
 
 \figureRandFrame

\forcingDefinition

By $\mathcal{L}_{C(q)}$ we are implicitly talking about the language of the structure $C(q)$. \cite{book1} defines language extensions with more details that are not necessary here.

\intuitionisticValidityDefinition

In classical logic, this definition simplifies, and it is simplified again by the fact that there is a unique world (R is a singleton); in fact, here we will define classical validity as: \cite{book1}

\classicalValidityDefinition

\section{The Intuitionistic Tableaux Method}

\subsubsection{Considerations}


    Here we first define a slightly different version of the destructive tableaux proof tree described by \cite{book1}, where each node is a truth assertion. This different version  will allow for a more implementation-oriented approach and the translation later on.

    The correspondence of the destructive tableaux proof tree described in \cite{book1} to our new one is shown in Figure \ref{fig:non_destructive_to_destructive_tableaux}.
     Generally speaking, a node collects all the signed sentences that appeear on the sequence of nodes in the path that goes from the root to it.
      Afterwards, some nodes are removed from the newly formed tableau by adjoining its children and its parent.
       A node should be removed if its corresponding node in the original tableau was not a leaf of the atomic tableau rule  \cite{book1} that introduced it.

    \begin{figure}
\tableauxCumulativeAndNonCumulativeExampleFigure
\caption{Example of a destructive tableaux proof tree from \cite{book1}, the intermediary structure and the non-destructive tableaux proof tree.}
\label{fig:non_destructive_to_destructive_tableaux}
\end{figure}
    In this new format, one could see each node of the tree as an assumption of the existence of 
    a frame that respects a list of constraints, and each edge as an implication between assumptions.
\subsubsection{The Intuitionistic Tableaux Method }
The tableaux method stands on some definitions, they will be justified briefly:
\signedSentenceIntuitionisticDefinition
 

A signed sentence list can be seen as a model-existence assumption that may or may not consistently lead to a frame. We can infer other assumptions from a  signed sentence list. The function f, defined below, is one of the ways we can do that: 


\fIntuitionisticDefinition


Although not justified here, the reordering of the terms plays an important role on the implementation and in the completeness of the systematic tableaux method.: 
each signed sentence will be $\sigma$ infinitely many times.

On the other hand, 
the soundness of the tableaux method states that f is well-behaved:

\wellBehavedTheorem

\TableauxDevelopmentListDefinition

\TableauxDevelopmentExampleFigure

\soundnessTheorem



    From this, we can conclude that: 
        If all leaves of $ \hookleftarrow (\sigma_n,\hookleftarrow(\sigma_{n-1}(.....(\hookleftarrow(\sigma_1 , F\phi)...)))) $ are contradictory, then $F\phi$ is not intuitionistically valid, by consequence 
        $\phi$ is intuitionistically valid. 
        

\subsubsection{Completeness }

For purposes of implementation, we define an $\hookleftarrow_c$ that can be applied systematically: 

\completeiteratordefinition

We can use $\hookleftarrow_c$ instead of $\hookleftarrow$ to define a systematic tableaux method. This was important for generating tableaux proofs in order to test 
the translation implementation. This will not be discussed further, as the translation assumes a tableaux proof not necessarily equal to one given by $\hookleftarrow_c$.


\section{The Classical Tableaux Method}

The classical tableaux method can be seen as the intuitionistic tableaux method restricted to 
one-framed structures. The adapted definitions are: 


\signedSentenceClassicalDefinition 
\fClassicalDefinition






\section{Sequent Calculus}
    Here we use the multi-conclusion sequent calculus defined in \cite{book2}. 

\sequentDefinition

$\Gamma $ represents multiple necessary hypothesis, while $\Delta$ represents multiple possible conclusions. 
\sequentValidityDefinition
\paragraph{}
The more awkward definition:


"
A sequent is intuitionistically valid if there does not exist a frame 
that forces all sentences in $\Gamma$ and does not force any sentence in $\Delta$.
"

when compared with the definition of list of signed sentences, hints us towards an semantical equivalence between signed sentence lists and sequents for single framed structures. This will not be discussed in depth. 

\paragraph{}
A sequent-calculus rule can be interpreted as an implication: if the top sequent is 
 valid, then the bottom sequent is valid. Syntactically, each rule represents vertices that can be added to a sequent proof-tree development 
to obtain another sequent proof tree development

Below there are some examples of tableaux proof trees and sequent proof trees obtained by the 
implementation of $\hookleftarrow_c$ and $\mathcal{T}_p$. A 
sequent proof verifier was also develped and used on the examples.

\subsection{Intuitionistic Translation}


When examining the intuitionistic tableaux proof of  $\neg (A \land \neg A) \land (\neg X \land \neg Y)$ and attempting to choose 
appropriate words w for translation, we encounter an issue with the $\neg R$ rule: 
"useless" terms from our cumulative tableaux method can "overcrowd" the right side of the sequent equation. 
A first naive approach would be to remove all useless sentences. 
Another way to view this is that the sequent calculus has a Weakening rule that we have not yet utilized.
We will show later on that this suficient for non-branching tableau.
\ThinningFunctionDefinition
We must, of course, be sure we have not removed "too much":
\thinnedInvalidityproof
\thinnedsizeproof
A first goal would be to prove that the non-branching parts (the last branches) of a thinned tableaux never have two signed sentences of type F.
One way would be to use the fact that when assuming $A$ and $B$ not valid, a sequent of type $ \vdash A, B$ is not provable in intuitionistic sequent calculus. 
By the completeness of intuitionistic sequent calculus that would mean that the sequent $ \vdash A, B$ is invalid. A proof in this direction would not be
 interesting, as it would use the translation to demonstrate a property of the translation that we are trying to show. 


 A less semantics-oriented approach would be to look at the general format that the root r' of a thinned not branching tableau $\mathcal{F}(t)$ can have. Knowing 
 that a contradiction always has the format  
 $F_p ( ) T_q ( ), $ with $ p = q$, 
 we can inspect the formats of the sequence lists that could have generated it.

 \begin{figure}
    \thinnedExampleImageI
    \thinnedExampleImageII
    \caption{Example of a thinned tableaux proof tree and its transitions.}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{figure}
 \nnn
 \caption{The possible transitions between formats of nodes in a thinned tableau, possible by the $F_\neg$ rule. Translations in incomparable formats were omited, as they never lead to a contradiction.}
 \label{figureneg}
 \end{figure}

 Figure 8 can be an example for the representation: an arrow goes from $X_p () Y_q (), $ with $ p r q $ to $X'_p () Y'_q ()  $ with $ p r' q $ if the root of a $\mathcal{F}(\tau)$ can have the format $X_p () Y_q ()  $ with $ p r q $
  and the root of $\mathcal{F}(\hookleftarrow(F \neg \alpha ,\tau))$
 can have the format $X'_p () Y'_q () $ with $ p r' q $. 

     

If we were to do all of them, we can inspect that the root  of a thinned not branching tableaux proof can never have 
the formats $\\ F_p () F_q () \text{ with }  p=q$, \\ $F_p () F_q ()  \text{ with }  p>q$, \\$T_p () F_q () \text{ with } p>q$.
This exaustion, shown in figure 10, proves that these states never reach the state [$F_p ( ) T_q ( ), $ with $ p = q$s]

\section{Implementation}
    The work was implemented in OCAML, and the code is available at \url{github.com/lontra-lontra/proof-translations}.
    The implementation of the classical tableaux method and the translation to sequent calculus is complete, and the intuitionistic logic case is partially implemented.
    More precisely:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The classical tableaux method, classical sequent calculus, classical transilation and classical sequent calculus proof verification are implemented in the folder \textbf{classical}. 
        \item The intuitionistic definitions from 1.2 are implemented in the folder \textbf{intuitionistic\_defintions}.
        \item The intuitionistic tableaux method is partially implemented in the folder \textbf{intuitionistic\_tableaux}.
        \item The main function is in the main file, it contains some possible configurations for testing the implementation.
        \item The output folder contains some .tex files with the representation of some of the structures seen in this document, as well as some automatically generated tableaux proofs and their translations to sequent calculus.
    \end{itemize}
    The more up-to-date correspandnce between the OCAML code and the definitions in this document can be found in the README.md file in the root of the repository.

\section{ Conclusion}
    This work was an exercise in several important aspects of research — notably,
     the deep comprehension and clear expression of the subjects studied. The github repository presents the 
     the OCAML generation of classical tableaux proofs, translation to sequento sequent calculus proofs, and the verification of the classical sequent-calculs proofs. Some
     progress was made in the intuitionistic logic case.
     The next step would be to analyze the translatability behavior in branching nodes in the intuitionistic logic case.
