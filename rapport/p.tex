\begin{abstract}
This work aims to discuss the translation between Tableaux proofs and sequent calculus proofs in first-order intuitionistic predicate logic and in first-order classical predicate logic.
It begins with an overview of the definitions and clarification of the notation.
It then shows a translation process in classical logic and its OCAML implementation restricted to propositional logic. 
Finally, a potential extension towards translation in intuitionistic logic is discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Notation}


%See Figure~\ref{fig:first} and Figure~\ref{fig:second}. asdf %

In this work, sentences will implicitly refer to first-order predicate logic sentences; for intuitionistic logic, their meaning will come from Kripke's semantics \cite{kripke1965} . The notation for structures and frames will be heavily based on \cite{book1}. 
In order to make this document slightly more self-reliant and to clarify the notation, we will briefly explain:
\subsection{Definitions}
%(TODO how detailed? < or > than thepresentation? )

\structureDefinition
Structures represent possible worlds or possible states of knowledge inside a frame:
\kripkeFrameDefinition

Particularly, in order to simplify the notation, R will always be the set of sequences of integers, and $p \leq q$ if it exists an $l$ such that $q =  p||l$  . 
 Also, from now on, the constant elements of a language will always be in the ordered set $\{c_0, c_1, c_2 ...\}$
 
 \figureRandFrame

\forcingDefinition

\intuitionisticValidityDefinition

In classical logic, this definition simplifies to the one of forcing, and it's simplified again by the fact that p = q; in fact, here we will define classical validity as: \cite{book1}

\classicalValidityDefinition

\section{The Intuitionistic Tableaux Method}

\subsubsection{Considerations}
    Here we first define a slightly different version of the destructive tableaux proof tree described by \cite{book1}, were each node is a truth assertion. This different version  will allow for a more implementation-oriented approach and the translation later on.

    The correspondence of the destructive tableaux proof tree described in \cite{book1} to our new one is shown in Figure \ref{fig:destructive_tableaux}. Generally speaking, a node in the usual definition is replaced by a sequence of all nodes in the path that goes from the root to it. Afterwards, some nodes are removed from the newly formed tableaux by adjoining its son(s) and its parent. A node should be removed if its corresponding node in the original tableaux was not a leaf of the atomic tableaux \cite{book1} that introduced it.


\tableauxCumulativeAndNonCumulativeExampleFigure
    In this new presentation, one can see each node of the tree as an assumption of the existence of 
    a frame that respects a list of constraints, and each edge as an implication between assumptions.
\subsubsection{The Intuitionistic Tableaux Method }
The tableaux stands on some definitions, they will be justified briefly:
\signedSentenceIntuitionisticDefinition
 

A Signed sentence list can be seen as an existence assumption that may or may not be intuitionistically valid. We can infer other assumptions that are, by definition, 
consequences of a given assumption. The function f, defined bellow, is one of the ways we can do that: 


\fIntuitionisticDefinition


Although not justified here, the reordering of the terms plays an important role in the implementation and in the completeness of the systematic tableaux: 
each signed sentence will be $\sigma$ infinitely many times.

On the other hand, 
the soundness of the tableaux method depends on the fact that f is 'well-behaved":

\wellBehavedTheorem

By choosing $c_i$ differently, we might arrive at at a intuitionistic invalid [Q irrespectable?] tableaux.   


\TableauxDevelopmentDefinition

\TableauxDevelopmentExampleFigure

\soundnessTheorem



    From this, we can conclude that: 
        If all leaves of $ \hookleftarrow (\sigma_n,\hookleftarrow(\sigma_{n-1}(.....(\hookleftarrow(\sigma_1 , F\phi)...)))) $ are contradictory, then $F\phi$ is not intuitionistically valid, by consequence 
        $\phi$ is intuitionistically valid. 
        

\subsubsection{Completeness }

For purposes of implementation, we define an $\hookleftarrow_c$ that can be applied systematically: 

\completeiteratordefinition

we can use $\hookleftarrow_c$ instead of $\hookleftarrow$ to define a systematic tableaux

[TODO]

\section{The Classical Tableaux Method}

The classical tableaux method can be seen as the intuitionistic tableaux method restricted to 
one-framed structures. The adapted definitions are: 


\signedSentenceClassicalDefinition 
\fClassicalDefinition






\section{Sequent Calculus}
    Here we use the multi-conclusion sequent calculus defined in \cite{book2}. 

\sequentDefinition

$\Gamma $ represents multiple necessary hypothesis, while $\Delta$ represents multiple possible conclusions. 
\sequentValidityDefinition
\paragraph{}
The more awkward definition:


"
A sequent is classically valid if there does not exist a single-sentenced frame 
that forces all sentences in $\Gamma$ and does not force any sentence in $\Delta$.
"

when compared with the definition of list of signed sentences, hints us towards an equivalence for single framed structures. This will not be discussed in depth. 

\paragraph{}
The meaning of a sequent calculus rule is [Question : is "meaning" too strong? -> maybe change to "a sequent calculus rule can be interpreted as"] the implication: if the top sequent is 
 valid, then the bottom sequent is valid.
 
 Syntactically, each of the rules represent vertices that can be added to a sequent proof tree development 
to obtain another sequent proof tree development
