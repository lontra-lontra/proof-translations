\begin{abstract}
Tableux proof are used in automated  "proofers" as (TODO), wereas sequent calculus 
proofs are used in proof assitants as (TODO). This work aims to present a systematic 
algorithm for translating tableaux proofs into sequent calculus proofs.
It begins with an overview of the definitions underlying such translations 
in both intuitionistic and classical logic.
 It then shows a translation process in classical logic, along with its properties. 
 Finally, potential extensions toward translations in intuitionistic logic are explored.

\section{Underlying concepts}
(TODO how detailed? < or > than thepresentation? )
The sintax and semantics from both classical and intuitionistic logic is based on \cite{book2}. 
In this work, functions wont' be worked with

()Language consits of a finite set of variables, constants conectives, quantifiers, and Predicate symbols

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\begin{credits}
\subsubsection{\ackname} A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is
used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded
by X (grant number Y).

\subsubsection{\discintname}
It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments\footnote{If EquinOCS, our proceedings submission
system, is used, then the disclaimer can be provided directly in the system.},
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
